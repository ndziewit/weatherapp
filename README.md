## Weather Dashboard

This application is used to show the weather and upcoming forcast for a user-specified city. After entering a city name in the search bar and clicking the "Search" button, that city's current weather will be displayed along with icons and and color-coded UV Index as well as a 5-day upcoming forecast underneath.
Searched cities are stored in a list to the left and weather can be recalled by clicking upon the city name in the list.
When the user closes the webpage and reopens, the last searched city's weather will automatically populate the page.
